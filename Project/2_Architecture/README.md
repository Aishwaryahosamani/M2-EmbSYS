## Components

* Arduino Uno
     
     All sensors,motors and peripherals are interfaced witH Arduino Uno. Arduino senses the data and sends commands to  LCD and Motors

* IR Sensor
     
     IR Sensors are used to sense the availabity of empty slots    
 
* Servo Motor
     
     The system shall use servo motor to open and close the gate  

* I2C Module
     
     Enables communication between Arduino and LCD 
     
 * LCD Display
      
      On LCD, visitors may observe the status of the available free parking space outside the parking lot.

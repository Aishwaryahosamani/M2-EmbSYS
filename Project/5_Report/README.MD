# Identifying features

1. IR Sensors are provided for easy detection of movement of vehicles.
2. LCD to be used to see the status of the availability of parking slots.
3. Servo motors for simulation as gate opener motors.


# State of art/Research

Car parking is a huge issue in today's congested cities, as the number of automobiles increases. In congested and densely populated urban areas, 
the unavailability of parking spots is growing severe, so car parking is a major concern. As a result, effective parking management systems are required.

# Applications

  Useful wherever parking is available like;
 
 Airports
 
 Bus stops
 
 Railway stations
 
 School and collages  etc...
 
 # Description

  Automatic car parking system is capable of automatically locating open parking spaces that are empty. New vehicles are allowed to enter the automated car parking if there is an empty slot.# Block Diagram of Car Parking System.

## Components

* Arduino Uno
     
     All sensors,motors and peripherals are interfaced witH Arduino Uno. Arduino senses the data and sends commands to  LCD and Motors

* IR Sensor
     
     IR Sensors are used to sense the availabity of empty slots    
 
* Servo Motor
     
     The system shall use servo motor to open and close the gate  

* I2C Module
     
     Enables communication between Arduino and LCD 
     
 * LCD Display
      
      On LCD, visitors may observe the status of the available free parking space outside the parking lot.

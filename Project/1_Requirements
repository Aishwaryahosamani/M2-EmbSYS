# Identifying features

1. IR Sensors are provided for easy detection of movement of vehicles.
2. LCD to be used to see the status of the availability of parking slots.
3. Servo motors for simulation as gate opener motors.


# State of art/Research

Car parking is a huge issue in today's congested cities, as the number of automobiles increases. In congested and densely populated urban areas, 
the unavailability of parking spots is growing severe, so car parking is a major concern. As a result, effective parking management systems are required.

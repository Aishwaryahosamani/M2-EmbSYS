## Identifying features

1. IR Sensors are provided for easy detection of movement of vehicles.
2. LCD to be used to see the status of the availability of parking slots.
3. Servo motors for simulation as gate opener motors.


# State of art/Research

Car parking is a huge issue in today's congested cities, as the number of automobiles increases. In congested and densely populated urban areas, 
the unavailability of parking spots is growing severe, so car parking is a major concern. As a result, effective parking management systems are required.

# Requirements

## High Level Requirements

 |   ID          |Description                         | 
 |--------------------|------------------------------------|
 |HLR01      |The  system shall sense the availabilty of empty slots   |
 |HLR02   |The system  shall able to open and close the gate  |
 |HLR03   |Shall be able to display the status of availability    | 
 |HLR04   | shall be able to allow new cars |
 
 
 ## Low Level Requirements
 
  |   ID           |Description                         | 
 |--------------------|------------------------------------|
 |LLR01   |IR Sensors are used to sense the availabity of empty slots    |
 |LLR02     | the system shall use servo motor to open and close the gate    |

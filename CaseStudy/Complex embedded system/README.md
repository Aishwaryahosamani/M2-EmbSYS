The architecture of a smart card includes three elements like :

I/O System

CPU or Central processing unit

Memory

I/O System

The smart card includes specific components to execute the functions of input/output. It includes an internal logic circuit to work in 

combination with the microprocessor for controlling the timintg as well as data flo0w that is transferred into memory of the card.

The physical structure of this card can easily interface to a card reader and it is connected to host computers to exchange the data.

CPU(Central processing unit)

The microprocessor otherwise a cpu is the component that differentiates the smart cards from other types of cards that are aminly usedto store the data.

The processor is in connection through the operating system that allows the smart-card to make its own choices regarding where the inforation is stored

within memories & under what conditions it must transfer data through its I/O interface.The microprocessor includes three components such as ALU,the 

control unit & the bus.

Memory

The memories which are employed in these cards are mainly manufactured by using semiconductor materials. These memories include matrices of cells that 

are formed through transistors to store the data. The semiconductor memories which are used in thses cards are three typeswhich include the following.

1.ROM(Read only memory)

2.RAM(Random access memory)

3.EEPROM(Eletrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)

 
 working 

A smart card does not function alone and it requires a smart card reader to work properly.

The working process of smart card includes following steps;

1.It is placed nto the card reader to read the data from the card.

2.Once the card reader reads the data from the card,then it passes the data toward the payment system otherwise authentication system.

3.After that, the payment syste                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               m otherwise an authentication system aunthenticates the operator whether the information provided by the card matches through 

the database.

4.Finally, the payment system otherwise the authentication system does the necessary task.
